## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of real estate properties using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data and relevant features, the model can provide insights into property valuations, aiding buyers, sellers, and investors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information on various properties, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant features. [Provide details about the dataset source, size, and any preprocessing steps taken.]

## Features

Key features considered in the model include:

- **Location**: Geographic coordinates or neighborhood information.
- **Size**: Total area of the property (e.g., square feet or square meters).
- **Number of Bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in the property.
- **Number of Bathrooms**: Total number of bathrooms.
- **Year Built**: The year the property was constructed.
- [Include any other relevant features used in the model.]

## Modeling Approach

The modeling process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most significant features that influence property prices.
3. **Model Selection**: Experimenting with various regression models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Results

The final model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: [3.21]
- **Standard Deviation**: [0.74]


## Usage

To use this model:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alphaa-particle/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction---ML-Model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Real-Estate-Price-Prediction---ML-Model
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
